\section{Introduction}
We are simulation a population model, where every creature has a gene and we are investigating the mutations of different genes.
This is trying to mimic real life evulation with mutation.\\\\
\textit{To be continued...}
\section{Methods}
\subsubsection{Creature}
A creature is defined with its genome, position and energy.
The genome consists of 5 genes that represent certain characteristics of that creature.
The position shows the creature's position in the grid and the energy shows its energy level.
\subsubsection{Food}
Food are randomly generated when a simulation is initiated and randomly spawns in each timestep, but with a predefined limit.
\subsubsection{Energy}
A creature starts with predefined base energy level, and dies when the energy level reaches 0.
The creatures gains energy by consuming food or winning an attack against another creature, and loses energy when moving.
\subsubsection{Attack}
A creature has a gene for its level of aggression, which shows how likely it is to initiate an attack.
The winner is determined by the strength gene. The winner gains energy, while the loser dies.
\subsubsection{Reproduction and Mutations}
If a creature gains energy with a certain ratio of its maxmimum energy, it reproduces and gives 1 offspring, and loses a certain ratio of its energy.
The offspring is spawned in an adjacent positon and each gene is copied from its parent, with a certain probability for each gene to change by a value of 1.
\subsection{Memory optimization}
The creature is defined as an unsigned 32-bit integer, where the first 16 bits represent the genome, the next 12 bits represent its position cell and the last 4 bits represent the energy.
\subsection{Energy loss}
\[\text{energy loss}=\text{steps}+\left\lceil\frac{\text{eyesight}}{3}\right\rceil+\left\lfloor\frac{\text{aggression}}{5}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\sqrt{\text{strength}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{\text{stamina}}{7}+1\right\rfloor\]
\[\text{eyesight}\in\{0,1,...,7\}\]
\[\text{aggression}\in\{0,1,...,7\}\]
\[\text{strength}\in\{1,2,...,16\}\]
\[\text{stamina}\in\{-7,-6,...,8\}\]
All these values have an effect on how much energy the creature spends. Steps are the number of steps. We have no energy loss from aggression, up until the value of 5.

    \hline
    Gene & Bits & Description  \\\hline
    Speed & 2 & Takes values between 1 and 4, showing the Manhattan distance the creature can walk in a single timestep.\\\hline
    Eyesight & 3 & Takes values between 0 and 7, showing the Manhattan distance the creature can see.\\\hline
    Aggression & 3 & Takes values between 0 to 7, mapped to 0\% - 100\%, showing the probability of the creature attacking another creature in the same cell. \\\hline
    Strength & 4 & Takes values between 1 and 16, which determines the winner in a fight \\\hline
    Stamina & 4 & Takes values between -7 and 8, which is added to the base energy level, when generating the creature\\\hline

The creatures are stored in a list and are iterated over in every timestep.
\section{Results}

\section{Discussion}
We have simulated the model with several cases, however we may try on more complex cases.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Random genes. Try many random genes for creatures and see if we reach equilibrium of one gene.
    \item Strong specific genes. Start with high values for specific genes and see if we reach equilibrium or not after mutaitons.
    \item Record the evolution of each gene by averaging that genes during each timestep.
\end{enumerate}
